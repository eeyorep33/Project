They can also be used outdoors. The Villain and Villain wide wheels offer great grip and lots of speed thanks to the 84A material combined with the Shark hub. 

         The Shark hub is made in the USA. 

         Quantum Urethane Quantum Urethane is Radar’s Hybrid formula urethane. It is extremely grippy and is very fast when combined with the Shark hub on the Villain and Villain wide. The Quantum formula used for this Villain is 84A. 

         Shark Hub Designed with convex fins that provide stiffness to the outer edge of the wheel and allow the wheel’s tire to perform at its optimal level. Traditional hubs with square or concave designs flex and limit urethane performance, resulting in slow and sludgy wheels. The Shark hub provides superior roll (speed), and balanced support from the outside through the middle and inside edge of the wheel. Shark Hubs are made in the USA with superior grade urethane which creates an intense bond with urethane tires. It is the finest, ultralight synthetic hub available.

         Zombie wheels feature anodized aluminum hubs for maximum durability and precise feel while maintaining rock solid stability. This allows our unique urethane compounds to deliver all your power to the floor. Choose the Zombie combination that fits your skating style and surface. 

         Zombie Aluminum Core
         Designed in house and manufactured using state of the art machining technology. What makes this different from other aluminum cores? The Zombie core is machined from a solid billet of aluminum, using the same manufacturing processes that Sure-Grip uses to make their famous Power Trac racing plates. This increases strength and allows them to machine the hub to a tighter tolerance than any other hub on the market creating the perfect fit between bearing and inner core. Cores are then treated with a special anodizing process to increase hub durability and urethane bonding. This technology is unique to the Zombie wheel line. 

         Zombie Insane Urethane
         Tired of new wheels not performing like your last set? The Zombie wheel will never have this problem. Specially formulated to Sure-Grip's exact specifications that were developed from 75 years in the skate wheel business. What makes this wheel different from the rest? All wheels are poured using a precise time schedule to ensue product quality throughout the range. Typically wheels are poured over time, sometimes days. This can change the characteristic of a wheel poured one day vs. another or even morning vs. afternoon. This timing is what make the Zombie wheel the most unique wheel on the market.
