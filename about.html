        Debugging plays tunes from a variety of genres, and their influences include bands like Evanescence and RHCP. Look

            <p class="biopara"> Cicada has been playing the saxaphone since he was 2 years old, much to the horror of his neighbors.Producing
                ear screeching sounds, Cicada plays the saxaphone as often and as loudly as possible.</p>

            <h5 class="biotitle">Spider: Drums</h5>
            <p class="biopara">Spider may have only been playing the drums for 2 months, but in that 2 months he has figured out how to not
                hit himself in the head with the drumsticks! Great job, Spider!</p>

            <p class="biopara">Mosquito has been jamming on the bass guitar in his parents basement(where he still lives) for many years. He
                claims the acoustics in the basement are just so good he sees no reason to move out. </p>

            <h5 class="biotitle">Wasp: Banjo</h5>
            <p class="biopara">Wasp is a little bit county and a little bit rock and roll with his whimsical banjo stylings. It doesn't really
                sound good with the rest of the band, but we felt bad saying no.</p>

            <h5 class="biotitle">Daddy Long Legs: Lead Vocals</h5>
            <p class="biopara">Affectionately referred to as "Daddy", Mr. Long Legs screams and wails his heart out on and off the stage. In
                fact he can't seem to help himself; which is rather embarrassing in the grocery store.

            <h5 class="biotitle">Mantis: Keyboard</h5>
            <p class="biopara">Mantis actually goes on stage with her dog. The little porker waddles around stage and wags in sync to the music.
                We're also pretty sure the dog can play the keyboard better than Mantis.

            <h5 class="biotitle">Locust: Lead Guitar</h5>
            <p class="biopara">Locust loves playing his guitar so much he calls it "Precious"(you need to say it in the creepy voice to get
                the full effect). He sleeps with it, goes to the store with it and cuddles with it. Too bad he doesn't practice
                with it.</p>
